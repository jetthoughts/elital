## Service Discovery

- Implement service registry
- Use dynamic service discovery
- Handle failover scenarios
- Monitor service health

## Load Balancing

- Choose appropriate algorithms
- Implement circuit breakers
- Handle retry logic
- Monitor performance metrics

## Data Management

- Choose the right database per service
