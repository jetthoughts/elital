Here's a quick tip: set your calendar to show multiple time zones. It helps you plan better and avoid confusion.

> Balancing work and personal time is crucial. Make sure to set boundaries. When work is over, shut down your computer and step away. This helps maintain a healthy balance and prevents burnout.
